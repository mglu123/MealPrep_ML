Mealprep offers a toolkit, made with care, to help users save time in the data preprocessing kitchen. 

## Overview

Recognizing that the preparation step of a data science project often requires the most time and effort, `mealprep` aims to help data science chefs of all specialties master their recipes of analysis. This package tackles pesky tasks such as classifying columns as categorical or numeric ingredients, straining NA values and outliers, and automating a preprocessing recipe pipeline.

## Functions
`find_fruits_veg()`: This function will drop rows with NAs and find the indices of columns with all
    numeric values or categorical values based on the specification.
    
`find_missing_ingredients()`: For each column with missing values, this function will create a reference list of row indices, sum the number, and calculate the proportion of missing values.
    
`find_bad_apples()`: This function uses a univariate approach to outlier detection. For each column with outliers (values that are 2 or more standard deviations from the mean), this function will create a reference list of row indices with outliers, and the total number of outliers in that column.

`make_recipe()`: This function is used to quickly apply common data preprocessing techniques.

## Mealprep and Python's Ecosystem

**mealprep** complements many of the existing packages in the Python ecosystem around the theme of data preprocessing. When preparing a dataframe for a machine learning preprocessing pipeline, it is time consuming to manually note which columns are categorical and numerical, particularly for large datasets. The [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) function `df.select_dtypes()` comes close by allowing users to select columns with data corresponding to specific data types however the output of this function is a pandas dataframe. `find_fruits_veg()` aims to fill this void by producing a list of columns corresponding to the categorical and numerical groups.  

In terms of missing values, [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) package’s `isna()` function converts all elements of a pandas.dataframe or pandas.series to boolean values representing if they are missing values. The package [autoimpute](https://autoimpute.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a suite of tools to fill missing values in a dataset through multiple univariate, multivariate and time series methods. The gap between these packages is that neither provides you a summary of the missing values including the list of indices where they occur. `find_missing_ingredients()` augments these tools by providing a summary dataframe detailing which columns have missing values, as well as their count and proportion.

The [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) package’s `describe()` function is a staple in the data wrangling process because it returns several summary statistics for each numeric column in a dataframe, such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Viewing these statistics together is helpful for detecting outliers. However, the output of this function does not tell you which rows of data these outliers are found in, or how many outliers are present in the dataframe. Packages like the [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) toolkit and other functions that use clustering methods consider all variables at once to detect outliers for multivariate data. [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides over 20 algorithms to select from in detecting these outliers, which is handy for large multivariate datasets where you know you want to consider all features in detecting outliers, but can be a bit extreme for initial data exploration. The **mealprep** `find_bad_apples()` function lives happily in the space between [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-type solutions for outlier detection, where it provides more information than the [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) `describe()` function to point out datapoints which need further investigation, but does not consider all variables at once like the [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-type functions do.

Lastly, there are many great tools in the data science ecosystem for pre-processing data such as [scikit-learn preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html) in Python. However, you may find yourself frequently writing the same lengthy code for common preprocessing tasks (e.g scale numeric features and one hot encode categorical features). `preprocess_recipe()` provides a _shortcut function_ to apply your favourite recipes quickly to preprocess data in one line of code.


## Installation:

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ mealprep
```

## Examples

### `find_fruits_veg()`

Find the column indices for either numerical or categorical variables in your dataframe with the `find_fruits_veg()` function. 
The example below shows how to use find_fruits_veg() to find the index of the categorical column in a toy dataframe.

First, load the required packages.
```{python}
from mealprep.mealprep import find_fruits_veg
import pandas as pd
```

If you don't already have a dataframe to work with, run this code to set up a toy dataframe (`df`) for testing.
```{python}
df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2], 'col2': ['a', 'b']})
df
```

Then, apply the `find_fruits_veg()` function to the dataframe.
```{python}
find_fruits_veg(df, type_of_out = 'categ')
```


### `find_missing_ingredients()`

Before launching into a new data analysis, running the function `find_missing_ingredients()` on a dataframe of interest will produce a report on each column with missing values.

First, load the required packages
```{python}
from mealprep.mealprep import find_missing_ingredients
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

If you don't already have a dataframe to work with, run this code to set up a toy dataframe (`df`) for testing.
```{python}
test1= {'column1': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
       'column2': [1, 2, np.NaN, 3],
       'column3': [np.NaN] * 4}
   
df = pd.DataFrame(test1)
df
```

Then, apply the `find_missing_ingredients()` function to the dataframe.
```{python}
find_missing_ingredients(df)
```


### `find_bad_apples()`

Find the outliers in your data by applying the `find_bad_apples()` function to your dataframe.

First, load the required packages.
```{python}
from mealprep.mealprep import find_bad_apples
import pandas as pd
```

If you don't already have a dataframe to work with, run this code to set up a toy dataframe (`df`) for testing.
```{python}
df = pd.DataFrame({'A' : [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
                             1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
                    'B' : [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-100,
                             1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,100],
                    'C' : [1,1,1,1,1,19,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,19,1,1,1,1,
                             1,1,1,1,1,1,1,19,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]})
df
```

Then, apply the `find_bad_apples()` function to the dataframe.
```{python}
find_bad_apples(df)
```


### `make_recipe()`

Do you find yourself constantly applying the same data preprocessing techniques time and time again? `make_recipe` can help by applying your favourite preprocessing recipes in only a few lines of code.

Below `make_recipe` applies the following common recipe in only one line of code:

1. Split data into training, validation, and testing
2. Standardise and scale numeric features
3. One hot encode categorical features

First, load the required packages.
```{python}
from mealprep.mealprep import make_recipe
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from vega_datasets import data
```

If you don't already have a dataframe to work with, run this code to load the classic `mtcars` dataset for testing.
```{python}
df = pd.read_json(data.cars.url).drop(columns=["Year"])
X = df.drop(columns=["Name"])
y = df[["Name"]]
    
df.info()
```

Then, use `make_recipe` to quickly apply split your data and apply your favourite preprocessing techniques!
```{python}
X_train, X_valid, X_test, y_train, y_valid, y_test = make_recipe(
    X=X, y=y, recipe="ohe_and_standard_scaler", 
    splits_to_return="train_test")

X_train.head()
```
